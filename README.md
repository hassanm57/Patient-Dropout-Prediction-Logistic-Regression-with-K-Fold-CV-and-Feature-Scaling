## Description

The goal of this project is to create a predictive model that can identify patients at risk of dropping out of treatment programs. Using a logistic regression model, the project analyzes various features related to patient engagement and treatment adherence. The model is trained on a carefully selected subset of features to optimize performance.

## Techniques Used

- **Logistic Regression**: A statistical method for modeling binary outcomes, used to predict the probability of patient dropout.
- **K-Fold Cross-Validation**: This technique helps evaluate model performance by partitioning the dataset into multiple folds, training on K-1 folds, and validating on the remaining fold to prevent overfitting.
- **Feature Scaling**: Utilizes StandardScaler to standardize numerical features, improving convergence during model training.
- **Outlier Analysis**: Initial assessment of outliers was performed, though no modifications were made in this implementation.
- **Feature Selection**: Features were selected based on their importance and relevance to the prediction task.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed on your system along with the required libraries. Follow these steps to set up the environment:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/Patient-Dropout-Prediction.git
   cd Patient-Dropout-Prediction
   ```

2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Load the dataset and perform initial preprocessing.
2. Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
3. Fit the logistic regression model using the training data.
4. Evaluate the model performance using K-Fold Cross-Validation.
5. Make predictions using new data samples as needed.

Example code snippet for model fitting and evaluation:
```python
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import KFold
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report, confusion_matrix

# Initialize model
model = LogisticRegression(penalty='l2', C=1, random_state=42)

# Fit and evaluate the model with K-Fold Cross-Validation
kf = KFold(n_splits=5)
for train_index, test_index in kf.split(X):
    # Train and test your model here
```

## Data

The dataset used for this project contains information on patient treatment goals, engagement metrics, and whether the patient dropped out. Key features include:

- Number of Treatment Goals Revised
- Number of Times Treatment Plan Confirmed
- Number of Times Logged Into Health Portal
- Number of Educational Resources Viewed
- Patient Segment Types
- Number of Treatment Sessions Attended

## Model Evaluation

Model performance was evaluated using several metrics, including:

- **Accuracy**: Measures the proportion of correctly predicted instances.
- **Precision**: Indicates the accuracy of positive predictions.
- **Recall**: Measures the ability of the model to find all relevant instances.
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall, providing a balance between them.
- **ROC AUC**: Represents the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, measuring the model's ability to distinguish between classes.

Example output of evaluation metrics:
```
Average Accuracy: 0.9823
Average Precision: 0.9994
Average Recall: 0.9798
Average F1-Score: 0.9895
Average ROC AUC: 0.9923
```

## Results

The model demonstrated excellent predictive performance, achieving high accuracy, precision, and recall scores. These results indicate that the logistic regression model is effective in identifying patients at risk of dropping out, which can inform targeted interventions by healthcare providers.

## Challenges Encountered

During the project, several challenges were faced, including:

- **Feature Selection**: Identifying the most relevant features for prediction required careful analysis. Techniques such as Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) were employed to rank features based on their importance.
- **Data Imbalance**: The dataset may have had an imbalance between dropout and non-dropout instances, potentially affecting model performance. Techniques such as stratified sampling were used to address this issue during train-test splits.

## Conclusion

This project successfully developed a logistic regression model for predicting patient dropout rates in health treatment programs. The insights gained can help healthcare providers tailor interventions to enhance patient retention. Future work may involve exploring additional machine learning algorithms and refining the feature selection process for further improvements.
